//Did it work?

//Explanation of not working
We completed both a full 8 bit datapath and a controller, however there were what we believe to be minor problems in each of them.

In the Datapath:
	- Simulates, and appears to execute each state properly except for when the subtractor is used.
	- The add/sub consists of a working XOR and Full Adder cell.  We believe that the output may be coming out as the 2's compliment of what we expect when performing subtract operations, but are not sure.

	- we have included .sim and .cmd files for the individual cells from task 5.

In the Controller:
	- In the controller we needed the settle command to fix imbalances within the regsister
	-There seems to be a missing connection somewhere in the final build as the subcell works 
	- A test is provided which demonstrates the different states
	- 




//Help received
Our group did not receive any outside assistance, every transistor laid out is our own.
